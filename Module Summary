In this module, you learned that:

JavaScript is a scripting language that enables developers to add dynamic content to web pages.

 JavaScript variables are declared using the 'let' or 'const' keywords and take their type from the value assigned.

Program execution is controlled by statements like If…Then…Else, Switch, For loops, and While loops.

JavaScript uses blocks of code, called functions, that can be called from anywhere in the script.

New methods and properties can be added to an object by modifying the prototype for that object.

Prototypes allow you to define properties and methods for all instances of a specific object.

Client-side scripts are programs that accompany HTML documents and are used by developers to incorporate more interactive elements.

The script tag can incorporate a script within an HTML document or call a script from an external file.

The Document Object Model (DOM) is the programming interface between HTML or XHTML and JavaScript.

Developers can access HTML DOM elements from JavaScript scripts using the correct DOM notation.

APIs are often used to access HTML DOM elements in web pages.
